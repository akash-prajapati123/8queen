```python
Initialize population of N chromosomes randomly
Evaluate fitness of each chromosome
while termination condition is not met:
    Select parent chromosomes based on fitness (Selection)
    Apply crossover to produce offspring (Crossover)
    Mutate some offspring with a small probability (Mutation)
    Replace least fit individuals with new offspring (Replacement)
    Reevaluate fitness of population
Return best solution found

```
