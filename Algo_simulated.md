Simulated Annealing Algorithm
Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic technique used for approximating the global optimum of a given function. It is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, where a material is heated and then slowly cooled to remove defects, thereby minimizing the system's energy.

The algorithm is typically used in optimization problems to avoid getting trapped in local minima. The 8-Queens Problem fits well as an optimization problem since we want to minimize the number of conflicting queens.

Algorithm
Initial Solution: Start with a random configuration of queens on the chessboard.
Objective Function: Define an objective function that measures the number of conflicts between queens. The lower the conflicts, the better the solution.
Neighborhood Solution: A neighboring solution is generated by moving a queen to a different column in the same row.
Temperature: Control parameter that decreases over time. It governs the likelihood of accepting worse solutions (to allow escape from local optima).
Acceptance Probability: If a new solution is worse, it is accepted with a probability that decreases as the temperature lowers.
Termination Condition: The algorithm stops when the temperature is sufficiently low or a solution with no conflicts is found.
